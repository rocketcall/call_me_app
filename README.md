# Call Me Application

"Call Me" converts your website's users into engaged customers by creating an easy way for your customers to contact your sales and support teams right on your website. Using a simple form on your web page, your users can input a phone number and receive a phone call connecting to any destination phone number you like - the sales representative for that territory, your support call center, or an after hours voicemail.

This is a simple PHP application that allows you implement "Call me" functionality on your web page using Plivo.
